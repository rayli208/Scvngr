An all inclusive app to help keep track of your jobs. Anything you applie to gets created into a convenient card that can then be moved around depending on what stage of the job process you're in!

Cards can have their salary and notes area editted and saved when clicked a second time. The red trash can deletes the cards. 

Currently we are saving everything to local storage, but we plan on making this application have individual users saved to a database and everything imported individually per user. 

We also plan on having authentication added in soon!
